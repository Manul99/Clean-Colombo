## Clean Colombo
Developed a web application for the Colombo Municipal Council that allows residents to report garbage spots via their NFORCE accounts, with the ability to attach photos for clarity. The application includes a feature for the Captain to review and approve reports submitted by citizens. Admins can manage user accounts and upload motivational posters to encourage community engagement. Additionally, garbage collectors have access to view all approved reports, complete with detailed information on location and description, to facilitate efficient cleanup.
